This repository demonstrates a subtle difference in how HTML handles accessing non-existent attributes versus non-existent properties.  Accessing a non-existent property on an element silently returns `undefined`, whereas attempting to get a non-existent attribute can throw an error in some browsers. This can be a source of unexpected behavior and debugging challenges. The `bug.html` file showcases the issue, and `bugSolution.html` offers a solution involving robust error handling.
